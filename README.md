Install YouTrack 5.1.2 on OpenShift
===================================

If you don't have an OpenShift account yet go here https://www.openshift.com/get-started

Create a Tomcat 7 application here https://openshift.redhat.com/app/console/application_type/cart!jbossews-2.0

Enter https://github.com/sjuresa/youtrack-on-openshift in source code box.

When application is created, OpenShift will automatically launch the start script. It takes a while for the initialization to happen. If you get a Proxy Access Error just refresh once or few more times, if necessary.
